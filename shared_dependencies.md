The shared dependencies between the files "github_repository_manager.py", "docker_setup.py", and "finalization.py" are:

1. **GitHub API**: All three files will need to interact with the GitHub API to perform operations on the repository. This includes functions like `get_branches()`, `get_files()`, `move_files()`, `remove_files()`, `push_changes()`, and `merge_branches()`.

2. **Main Branch Name**: The name of the main branch is a shared variable across all three files as operations are performed on it.

3. **Docker-Compose File Name**: The name of the docker-compose file is a shared variable between "docker_setup.py" and "github_repository_manager.py" as it needs to be validated and placed in the main branch.

4. **Repository Name**: The name of the repository is a shared variable across all three files as operations are performed on it.

5. **User Authentication**: User credentials or tokens for GitHub API authentication will be shared across all three files.

6. **Error Messages**: Standardized error messages for failed operations like `branch_not_found_error`, `file_not_found_error`, `docker_validation_error`, `push_error`, and `merge_error` will be shared across all three files.

7. **Success Messages**: Standardized success messages for successful operations like `branch_review_success`, `file_consistency_success`, `docker_validation_success`, `push_success`, and `merge_success` will be shared across all three files.

8. **Critical Files List**: The list of critical files to be removed from development branches will be shared between "github_repository_manager.py" and "finalization.py".

9. **Essential Files List**: The list of essential files to be verified in the main branch will be shared between "github_repository_manager.py" and "docker_setup.py".
